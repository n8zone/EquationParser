# Equation Parser

### Background & Purpose
I first saw this challenge a few months ago when I had ChatGPT generate me a data structures roadmap. It intimidated the hell out of me, and so I shyed away from doing it.

Then, as an assignment for my Intro to Programming class we had to make a calculator that accepted a string such as '5 + 3' and could calculate it. I thought this would be hard at first, but I finished in about 4 minutes. I could have turned it in like that and moved on, but I saw an opportunity to challenge myself.

What was once a huge intimidating problem is now something I'm confidently working through.
